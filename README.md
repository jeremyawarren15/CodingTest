## Test 1
There is a feature in your application that accepts two numbers and returns the total in a string like this: "The sum of 3 and 4 are 7". Your product manager says that customers are complaining that this is just not flexible enough. He wants you to modify the code so that it can take a list of numbers and print it out like this: "The sum of 3, 4, 5, 1023, 234 and 1 is 1270". If there are two numbers it should behave just like the original function. If there is only one number then it should just print: "Your number is 42".
